# Automated Document Analysis

Many industries require document compliance checks, such as financial reports, legal contracts, or medical records. Traditionally, these checks require human review to verify text content and document structure (tables, forms, signatures, etc.). An AI-powered solution can streamline this process using LLMs and image processing.

Structural ideas for the first draft:
- Extract Text & Visual Elements
  - to extract printed or handwritten text from scanned documents
- Analyze Content with an LLM
  - Feed the extracted text to an LLM (such as OpenAI GPT or a fine-tuned BERT model) for semantic analysis, flagging compliance issues.
  - Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect key terms, dates, and sensitive data
